Frontend Mentor project with React

This is my first React project made from scratch. It's a project from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) with some changes and additions. 
I set it up with Vite, used React Router for pathing, and Sass for styling.

The challenge goals given by Frontend Mentor were the following. Users should be able to:
- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

I started the project using the recommended API but soon opted for using the local data.json file provided in the challenge files. At the time of making this project, the website for REST countries API was threatening to shut it down and I didn't want to risk my work going to waste. Therefore the data may not be completely up to date, and I don't accept responsibility for any errors there. 

To be continued...

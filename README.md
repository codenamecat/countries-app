Frontend Mentor project with React

This is my first React project made from scratch. It's a project from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) with some changes and additions. 
I set it up with Vite, used React Router for pathing, and Sass for styling.
